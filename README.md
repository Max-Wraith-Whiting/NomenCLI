# NomenCLI
A small collection of name generators bundled into an easy to use CLI.

**Much more to do before this even vaguely works...**

## Ideas
1. Static generators (using collections of relevant name components, i.e. Praenomen, Cognomen, Nomen, for Latin)
2. More dynamic generators (create names from collections of syllables rather than preselected words.)
3. Optional flags to make names genative, patronymic etc. (Person X of Place Y, Person X, son/daughter of Person Y)
